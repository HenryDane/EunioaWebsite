					<p> Eunoia was founded in July 2016 by a high school junior Grace Choi in Sacramento, CA. She started with a vision inspired by James 1:27 and decided to fulfill her longtime dream to start a non-profit that would benefit less fortunate teens in the Sacramento area. Her goal and prayer is that the organization grows from just being in the Sacramento area to being a nationwide organization that makes a big difference for those who need it most.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 20; font-family: serif; line-height: 1.1em;"> The non-profit has two parts: The <b>first part</b> is people in the community helping less fortunate teens and homeless youth. The <b>second part</b> is teens helping those in need in the community through community service.</p>					<br>
